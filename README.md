# passenger-counter-app
This was my first project in JavaScript, it allows you to count the passengers on a train. It increments everytime you press the button, it shows the previous entries, as well as it sums the total entries.

I'll add more functions to the project, but this is still in progress.

NOTICE: You need Satoshi font to use the visualise properly my app, but don't worry, it is a free font that can be downloaded at Fontshare.com
